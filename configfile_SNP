#==================================== 
## Sample configuration file for stratified LD score regression
## when SNP based heritability enrichment needs to be computed
#==================================== 

## The LD score regression requires reference dataset to be downloaded
## (hosted in https://storage.googleapis.com/broad-alkesgroup-public/LDSCORE/)
## This parameter is the data directory where all the S_LDSC related reference dataset will be downloaded
## this reference dataset consists of 1000G baseline model, ld scores 
## computed and shared by the developers (Alkes Price group)
DataDir=/home/sourya/LDSCORE_DATA

## Input GWAS file (we support hg19 coordinates)
## for hg38 based GWAS files, we will convert the GWAS to hg19 coordinates using liftover tool
InpGWASFile=/home/sourya/GWAS_Immune_Studies/Asthma_29785011/UKBB.asthma-2.assoc

## check if the GWAS input file has sample size (N) column.
## if the sample size column is not present, use this parameter to provide a sample size 
## (check the GWAS catalog and the corresponding study / publication to retrieve the sample size)
## if GWAS summary statistics contains sample size information, keep this parameter as blank
GWASsamplesize=110361

## if the GWAS file is already converted to Sumstats format
## (may be a prior execution of S_LDSC or any other packages like SLDP)
## user can put the existing Sumstats formatted file here (.sumstats.gz file)
## otherwise, keep this parameter blank
GWASSumStatsFile=

## directory containing the LDSC source code from GitHub
## user can download the LDSC source code from GitHub using the following command:
## git clone https://github.com/bulik/ldsc.git
## a folder "ldsc" would be created, containing the munge_sumstats.py source code (and other codes)
LDSCCodeDir=/home/sourya/packages/LDSC/ldsc

## output directory to store the S-LDSC results for the current GWAS and current eQTL data
OutDir=/home/sourya//S_LDSC/Asthma_29785011

## GWAS trait name - custom string
## the .sumstats file generated from LDSC will have the name ${GWASTraitName}.sumstats.gz
GWASTraitName=asthma

## set to 1 if in the GWAS Summary statistics, A1 is the increasing allele
## default = 0
A1IncAllele=0

## type of eQTL / variant - custom string
VariantType=DICE_eQTL_CD4N

## input eQTL / variant file
QTLFile=/home/sourya/DICE_eQTL/CD4N_eQTLs_FDR_0.05_SHORT.bed

## column containing the chromosome name in the input eQTL / variant file
chrcol=1

## column containing the SNP position in the input eQTL / variant file
## make sure that the position is with respect to hg19 coordinates
poscol=2
